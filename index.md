Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>. Prior to coming to Swarthmore, I was a joint postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://pcts.princeton.edu/">Princeton Center for Theoretical Science</a>, <a href="https://gravity.princeton.edu/">Princeton Gravity Initiative</a>, and as a John N. Bahcall fellow at the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/">Institute for Advanced Study.</a> I received my B.A. in Physics from <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/">Carleton College</a> and my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics from the <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>.

Research in my group centers on the study of neutron stars. Neutron stars are extreme objects, with masses
between ~1-2x the mass of our Sun, compressed by gravity to a radius of 10-13 km. As a result of this extreme compaction,
their central densities can reach on order "10^{15}" g/cm"^3", or several times the density of an atomic nucleus. One of the long-standing goals of both modern nuclear physics and astrophysics is to understand the properties and interactions of matter under these extreme conditions. Our research works to connect astrophysical observations of neutron stars with detailed models of the stellar interior, in order to probe the nature of ultra-dense matter.

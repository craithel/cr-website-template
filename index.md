Neutron stars are one of the most extreme environments in the universe. Their central densities can exceed 10^{15} g/cm^{3}, making them several times denser than matter that an atomic nucleus. What happens when matter is compressed to such densities is one of the big open questions in modern nuclear- and astro-physics. My research works to connect astrophysical observations of neutron stars with detailed models of the stellar interior, in order to probe the nature of ultra-dense matter.

I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in 2020. Most recently, I was a joint postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://pcts.princeton.edu/">Princeton Center for Theoretical Science</a>, <a href="https://gravity.princeton.edu/">Princeton Gravity Initiative</a>, and as a John N. Bahcall fellow at the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/">Institute for Advanced Study.</a>

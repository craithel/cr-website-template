<!--  ## Highlights -->

{% capture text %}

 I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist. My research centers on the study of neutron stars. I am particularly interested in using multi-messenger observations of neutron stars to study their interiors, which is a field that has been revolutionized by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy.
